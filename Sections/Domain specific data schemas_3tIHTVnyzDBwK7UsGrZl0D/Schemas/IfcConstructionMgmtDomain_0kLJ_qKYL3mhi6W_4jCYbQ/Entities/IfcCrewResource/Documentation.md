_IfcCrewResource_ represents a collection of internal resources used in construction processes.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0.

Identification of people and equipment of a crew is achieved through their specification at the level of the component. Therefore, knowing which persons are within a crew is achieved through identifying the persons assigned to each _IfcLaborResource_ within the _IfcCrewResource_. Similarly, identifying that a screwing machine for pipe fitting forms part of the crew is achieved by relating an appropriate instance of _IfcElementComponent_ to the _IfcConstructionEquipmentResource_ forming an element of the _IfcCrewResource_.
